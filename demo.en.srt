00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:10,005
We begin with the file system consistency check with udffsck tool.

2
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:13,488
As you can see, the tool didn't discovered any errors.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,720
Now we insert the medium to MS Windows 7.

4
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:20,648
We try to copy some data to the medium.

5
00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:32,504
We interrupt the copying during the process by physically removing the medium.

6
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:38,184
The medium is now broken and it's impossible to store any other data.

7
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:47,132
In OS Linux we use udffsck tool to check the medium for errors.

8
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:51,301
As you can see on the red lines, there are plenty of errors.

9
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:54,941
We will try to fix them.

10
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:59,373
We check the medium again with the tool, and as we see, the green lines indicate, what corrections were made.

11
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:04,086
Just for verification, we run the tool once again to ensure that it was fixed.

12
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,730
We can verify the success from MS Windows 7 by copying some data to the medium.

13
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:10,774
Data was successfully stored. The repair was successful.

14
00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:17,574
If we now check the medium by the udffsck tool again, we can see that a new file was correctly added to the file tree.

15
00:01:24,694 --> 00:01:27,694
Thank you for your attention.
